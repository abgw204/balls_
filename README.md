# 🎮 Simple 2D Shooter

A small 2D shooter game made with **C++** and **Raylib**.

You control a character using **WASD** and shoot with **left mouse click**. The goal is to hit as many bouncing balls as you can!

### 🧠 What I learned / challenges

- Working with basic **physics** like velocity, collision, and movement.
- Managing **game objects** (player, projectiles, enemies) using OOP.
- The usage of C++ STL containers to store data and use it efficiently as the game runs.
- Integrating **mouse input** and **keyboard controls** smoothly.
- Drawing sprites and updating the screen with **Raylib**’s rendering loop.

This project helped me get more comfortable with C++ logic and game loops, while keeping things fun and visual.

### ⚙️ How to Run

> Make sure you have **Raylib** (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and **make** installed on your system.

```bash
# Compile the game
make

# Run the executable
./balls
```
🛠 Still a work in progress, but already a great starting point for learning game dev with C++ and Raylib.
